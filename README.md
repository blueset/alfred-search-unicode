# Search Unicode

Search Unicode is an Alfred 4 Workflow to lookup and reverse lookup Unicode characters and emoji with their names.

## Download

Download it at the [release page](https://github.com/blueset/alfred-search-unicode/releases).

You need to install Python 3 on your macOS in order for this to work.
You can install that with [Homebrew] using the command below:

```sh
brew install python
```

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/

## Usage

### Search character by description

Type `u keyword` (ex. `u superscript`) to get a list of characters
matching the keyword.

- Press <kbd>Return</kbd> to copy the character to clipboard (ex. `‚Å∞`)
- Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> to copy its Hex code to clipboard (ex. `U+2070`)
- Press <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> to copy its name to clipboard (ex. `Superscript Zero`)

### Search character by code point

![Screenshot for command u fffd ff10](images/u_fffd_ff10.png)

Type `u codepoint [[codepoint] ...]` (ex. `u fffd ff10`) to look up characters by its codepoint.

The same 3 options apply here too.

### Search emoji by name

![Screenshot for command e face](images/e_face.png)

Type `e keywords` (ex. `e face`) to look up characters by its codepoint. Press <kbd>Return</kbd> to copy the character to clipboard (ex. `üòÄ`)

### Identify characters in a string

![Screenshot for command uid lenny face](images/uid_lenny.png)

Type `uid string` (ex. `uid ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)`) to identify characters in a string.

For the first 4 rows (hex sequence, integer sequence, UTF-8 sequence and XML escape sequence):

- Press <kbd>Return</kbd> to copy the sequence to clipboard (ex. `28 20 0361 B0 20 035C 0296 20 0361 B0 29`)

For the following rows that identifies each individual characters:

- Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> to copy its Hex code to clipboard (ex. `U+2070`)
- Press <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> to copy its name to clipboard (ex. `Superscript Zero`)
